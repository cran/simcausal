@article{ltmleMSMs2014,
abstract = {This paper describes a targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) for the parameters of longitudinal static and dynamic marginal structural models. We consider a longitudinal data structure consisting of baseline covariates, time-dependent intervention nodes, intermediate time-dependent covariates, and a possibly time-dependent outcome. The intervention nodes at each time point can include a binary treatment as well as a right-censoring indicator. Given a class of dynamic or static interventions, a marginal structural model is used to model the mean of the intervention-specific counterfactual outcome as a function of the intervention, time point, and possibly a subset of baseline covariates. Because the true shape of this function is rarely known, the marginal structural model is used as a working model. The causal quantity of interest is defined as the projection of the true function onto this working model. Iterated conditional expectation double robust estimators for marginal structural model parameters were previously proposed by Robins (2000, 2002) and Bang and Robins (2005). Here we build on this work and present a pooled TMLE for the parameters of marginal structural working models. We compare this pooled estimator to a stratified TMLE (Schnitzer et al. 2014) that is based on estimating the intervention-specific mean separately for each intervention of interest. The performance of the pooled TMLE is compared to the performance of the stratified TMLE and the performance of inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators using simulations. Concepts are illustrated using an example in which the aim is to estimate the causal effect of delayed switch following immunological failure of first line antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected patients. Data from the International Epidemiological Databases to Evaluate AIDS, Southern Africa are analyzed to investigate this question using both TML and IPW estimators. Our results demonstrate practical advantages of the pool},

@article{VanderWeele2014,
abstract = {Recent advances in the causal inference literature on mediation have extended traditional approaches to direct and indirect effects to settings that allow for interactions and non-linearities. In this paper, these approaches from causal inference are further extended to settings in which multiple mediators may be of interest. Two analytic approaches, one based on regression and one based on weighting are proposed to estimate the effect mediated through multiple mediators and the effects through other pathways. The approaches proposed here accommodate exposure-mediator interactions and, to a certain extent, mediator-mediator interactions as well. The methods handle binary or continuous mediators and binary, continuous or count outcomes. When the mediators affect one another, the strategy of trying to assess direct and indirect effects one mediator at a time will in general fail; the approach given in this paper can still be used. A characterization is moreover given as to when the sum of the mediated effects for multiple mediators considered separately will be equal to the mediated effect of all of the mediators considered jointly. The approach proposed in this paper is robust to unmeasured common causes of two or more mediators.},

@article{vdL2012a,
abstract = {We consider estimation of the effect of a multiple time point intervention on an outcome of interest, where the intervention nodes are subject to time-dependent confounding by intermediate covariates. In previous work van der Laan (2010) and Stitelman and van der Laan (2011a) developed and implemented a closed form targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) relying on the log-likelihood loss function, and demonstrated important gains relative to inverse probability of treatment weighted estimators and estimating equation based estimators. This TMLE relies on an initial estimator of the entire probability distribution of the longitudinal data structure. To enhance the finite sample performance of the TMLE of the target parameter it is of interest to select the smallest possible relevant part of the data generating distribution, which is estimated and updated by TMLE. Inspired by this goal, we develop a new closed form TMLE of an intervention specific mean outcome based on general longitudinal data structures. The target parameter is represented as an iterative sequence of conditional expectations of the outcome of interest. This collection of conditional means represents the relevant part, which is estimated and updated using the general TMLE algorithm. We also develop this new TMLE for other causal parameters, such as parameters defined by working marginal structural models. The theoretical properties of the TMLE are also practically demonstrated with a small scale simulation study.The proposed TMLE is building upon a previously proposed estimator Bang and Robins (2005) by integrating some of its key and innovative ideas into the TMLE framework.},
