The `simcausal` R package is a tool for specification and simulation of complex longitudinal data structures that are based on structural equation models (SEMs). The emphasis is on the types of simulations frequently encountered in causal inference problems, such as, observational data with time-dependent confounding, selection bias, and random monitoring processes. The interface allows for quick expression of dependencies between a large number of time-varying nodes.

### Brief overview

Below is an example simulating data with 4 covariates specified by 4 structural equations (nodes). New equations are added by using successive calls to `+ node()` function and data are simulated by calling `sim` function:

```R
library(simcausal)
D <- DAG.empty() + 
  node("CVD", distr="rcategor.int", probs = c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25)) +
  node("A1C", distr="rnorm", mean = 5 + (CVD > 1)*10 + (CVD > 2)*5) +
  node("TI", distr="rbern", prob = plogis(-0.5 - 0.3*CVD + 0.2*A1C)) +
  node("Y", distr="rbern", prob = plogis(-3 + 1.2*TI + 0.1*CVD + 0.3*A1C))
D <- set.DAG(D)
dat <- sim(D,n=200)
```

To display the above SEM object as a directed acyclic graph:

```R
plotDAG(D)
```

To allow the above nodes `A1C`, `TI` and `Y` to change over time, for time points t = 0,...,7, and keeping `CVD` the same, simply add `t` argument to `node` function and use the square bracket `[...]` vector indexing to reference time-varying nodes inside the `node` function expressions:

```R
library(simcausal)
D <- DAG.empty() + 
  node("CVD", distr="rcategor.int", probs = c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25)) +
  node("A1C", t=0, distr="rnorm", mean=5 + (CVD > 1)*10 + (CVD > 2)*5) + 
  node("TI", t=0, distr="rbern", prob=plogis(-5 - 0.3*CVD + 0.5*A1C[t])) +

  node("A1C", t=1:7, distr="rnorm", mean=-TI[t-1]*10 + 5 + (CVD > 1)*10 + (CVD > 2)*5) +
  node("TI", t=1:7, distr="rbern", prob=plogis(-5 - 0.3*CVD + 0.5*A1C[t] + 1.5*TI[t-1])) +
  node("Y", t=0:7, distr="rbern", prob=plogis(-6 - 1.2*TI[t] + 0.1*CVD + 0.3*A1C[t]), EFU=TRUE)
D <- set.DAG(D)
dat.long <- sim(D,n=200)
```

The `+ action` function allows defining counterfactual data under various interventions (e.g., static, dynamic, deterministic, or stochastic), which can be then simulated by calling `sim` function. In particular, the interventions may represent exposures to treatment regimens, the occurrence or non-occurrence of right-censoring events, or of clinical monitoring events.

In addition, the functions `set.targetE`, `set.targetMSM` and `eval.target` provide tools for defining and computing a few selected features of the distribution of the counterfactual data that represent common causal quantities of interest, such as, treatment-specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients from working marginal structural models. 


### Using networks in SEMs

Function `network` provies support for networks simulations, in particular it enables defining and simulating SEM for dependent data. For example, a network sampling function like `generate.igraph.ER` defined below can be used to specify and simulate dependent data from a network-based SEM:

```R
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example of a network sampler that will supplied as "netfun" argument to network(, netfun=);
# Returns (n,Kmax) matrix of net IDs (friends) by row;
# Each row i will contain the IDs (row numbers) of observation i's friends;
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gen.ER <- function(n, m_pn, ...) {
  m <- as.integer(m_pn*n)
  if (n<=10) m <- 20
  igraph.ER <- igraph::sample_gnm(n = n, m = m, directed = TRUE)
  sparse_AdjMat <- igraph.to.sparseAdjMat(igraph.ER)
  NetInd_out <- sparseAdjMat.to.NetInd(sparse_AdjMat)
  return(NetInd_out$NetInd_k)
}
```

Next step is to start defining a SEM that uses the above network, with a `+network` syntax and providing `generate.igraph.ER` to `netfun` argument:

```R
D <- DAG.empty()
# Define the network function and define its parameter(s) (m_pn):
D <- D + network("ER.net", netfun = "gen.ER", m_pn = 50)
# W1 - categorical (6 categories, 1-6):
D <- D + node("W1", distr = "rcategor.int", probs = c(0.0494, 0.1823, 0.2806, 0.2680, 0.1651, 0.0546))
# W2 - binary infection status, positively correlated with W1:
D <- D + node("W2", distr = "rbern", prob = plogis(-0.2 + W1/3))
```

New nodes (structural equations) can now be specified conditional on the past node values of observations connected to each unit `i` (friends of `i`). The friends will be defined by the network ID matrix that is returned by theÂ above network generator `gen.ER`. Double square bracket syntax `[[...]]` allows referencing the node values of connected friends. Two special variables `Kmax` and `nF` can be used along-side indexing `[[...]]`. `Kmax`  defines the maximal number of friends (maximal friend index) for all observation. When `kth` friend referenced by `Var[[k]]` doesn't exist, the default is to set that value to `NA`. Adding the argument `replaceNAw0=TRUE` to `node` function changes such values from `NA` to `0`. `nF` is another special variable, which is a vector of length `n` and each `nF[i]` is equal to the current number of friends for unit `i`. Any kind of summary function that can be applied to multiple time-varying nodes can be similarly applied to network-indexed nodes. For additional details, see the package documentation for the network function (`?network`).

```R
# Define network variable netW1 as the W1 values of first friends across all observations:
D <- D + node("netW1.F1", distr = "rconst", const = W1[[1]])
# Define the probability of each exposure A[i] being equal to 1 as a logit-linear function of:
# (1) W1[i]
# (2) sum of W1 values among all friends of i
# (3) mean value of W2 among all friends of i
D <- D + node("A", distr = "rbern",
              prob = plogis(2 + -0.5 * W1 +
                            -0.1 * sum(W1[[1:Kmax]]) +
                            -0.7 * ifelse(nF > 0, sum(W2[[1:Kmax]])/nF, 0)),
              replaceNAw0 = TRUE)
Dset <- set.DAG(D)
dat.net <- sim(Dset, n=1000)
```

The simulated data frame returned by `sim()` also contains the simulated network object, saved as a separate attribute. The network is saved as an `R6` object of class `NetIndClass`, under attribute called `netind_cl`. The field `NetInd` contains the network matrix, the field `Kmax` contains the maximum number of friends (number of columns in `NetInd`) and the field `nF` contains the vector for total number of friends for each observation (see `?NetIndClass` for more information).

```{r}
Kmax <- attributes(dat.net)$netind_cl$Kmax
Kmax
NetInd_mat <- attributes(dat.net)$netind_cl$NetInd
head(NetInd_mat)
nF <- attributes(dat.net)$netind_cl$nF
head(nF)
```
